# Hacker-Fake-News

Welcome to Hacker (Fake) News.
The "fake" is included because this is a spinoff of the real Hacker News by y.combinator.com.
This repo is an assingment for Springboard.

The website consists of HTML, JS, and CSS. I use the hack-or-snooze API to store information on users and user submits/favorites.
